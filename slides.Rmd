## Reproducible research

- Not a new concept
- Encouraged and growing within academia for last 10-15 years
- Provides evidence of the correctness of results
- Exposes workflow to others
- Enables others to make use of methods and results

Insert image of Trustworthiness pillar from UKSA code of practice to link with transparency principle - Carolyn

## Current publication process

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/current_state.png")
```

- Complex (many steps between software)
- Prone to error
- Manual, menial tasks carried out by highly skilled people
- Not reproducible or sustainable

Insert image of Quality pillar from UKSA code of practice to link with second bullet point - Carolyn

## The solution

```{r out.width = "60%", , fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/rap_matts.png")
```

[RAP companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)

Combined the priniciples of **reproducible research** with **data science tools and best practice**.

```{r out.width = "55%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/desired_state.png")
```

## Why R?

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/r_vs_python.jpg")
```

## What is RAP?

Insert jigsaw puzzle image - Carolyn

## Transforming Publishing test case: Hospital Standardised Mortality <br> Ratio publication

```{r out.width = "100%", fig.align = 'center'}
include_graphics("images/hsmr.png")
```

## Levels of automation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
    kable(automation_levels,
          col.names = c("Level", "Description"),
          format = "markdown")
```

## Challenges
- Culture change (peer review and working in the open)
- New software such as R and git
- Required development time
- Range of data sources and/or unstable production process
- IT (R server and internally hosted code repository)

## Interested in RAP?...

- How many reports do your team produce?
- What proportion of time is spent producing reports?
- How much copying and pasting/data movement between software is involved?
- What proportion of your spreadsheet or report contains errors?
- What would the impact of mistakes in production be?
- Could your team create the report if certain team members suddenly left?
- Could you reproduce your publication statistics from 5 years ago?
