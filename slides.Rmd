## Reproducible research

- Not a new concept
- Encouraged and growing within academia for last 10-15 years
- Provides evidence of the correctness of results
- Exposes workflow to others
- Enables others to make use of methods and results

Insert image of Trustworthiness pillar from UKSA code of practice to link with transparency principle - Carolyn

## Current publication process

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/current_state.png")
```

- Complex (many steps between software)
- Prone to error
- Manual, menial tasks carried out by highly skilled people
- Not reproducible or sustainable

Insert image of Quality pillar from UKSA code of practice to link with second bullet point - Carolyn

## The solution

Insert images of the two Matts
[RAP companion](https://ukgovdatascience.github.io/rap_companion/)

Combined the priniciples of **reproducible research** with **data science tools and best practice**.

```{r out.width = "60%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/desired_state.png")
```

## Why R?

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("images/r_vs_python.jpg")
```

## What is RAP?

Insert jigsaw puzzle image - Carolyn

## Transforming Publishing test case: Hospital Standardised Mortality <br> Ratio publication

Insert images of HSMR summary, report and excel tables

## Levels of automation

Not every publication (or piece of analytical work) will be suitable for the "Full RAP" treatment.

Insert table

## Interested in RAP?

Ask yourself the following questions... 
<br>
- How many reports do your team produce?
- What proportion of time is spent on producing reports?
- What would your team do if their time was freed up from menial, manual tasks?
- How much copying and pasting or data movement between software is involved?
- What would the impact of mistakes in production be, e.g.  policy or funding allocation?
- Could your team create the report if certain team members suddenly left?
- Could you reproduce your publication statistics from 5 years ago?
- What proportion of your spreadsheet or report contains errors?
